## How to run

Make sure you already install Java (both `jdk` and `jre`).


_You don't have to install gradle to run this app. This app is using gradle
wrapper locally._

- Build the app using `./gradlew build` (must run for the first time).
- Run the test using `./gradlew test`.
- Run the main app using `./gradlew run`.

*Disclaimer : This app is already tested locally using Java version 11 on
Linux. This app is also tested in Github Action using Java 17 on Linux, MacOS,
and Windows. The app surely can be run using the command above.*
